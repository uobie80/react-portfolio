                    <li>Architected and implemented a highly available clustered Oracle Identity Management deployment in a Red Hat Linux server environment. </li>
                    <li>	Developed custom scripts written in Python/Unix Shell to automatically monitor the utilization of CPU, memory, and hard disk space on Linux servers.</li>
                    <li>	Developed custom scripts written in Python/Unix Shell to automatically install and configure Oracle Identity Management suite of applications.  This helped save the client time and effort to build/re-build development, test, stage, and production environments in a matter of minutes instead of weeks.</li>
                    <li>	Developed custom standalone applications (.exe) written in Python to read and compare data extracts in csv format from multiple systems and produce a report in MS Excel format which identified data discrepancies amongst each of the systems.  This greatly helped insurance client improve data quality and keep it systems in sync.</li>
                    <li>	Developed several custom scripts written in Python to produce automated reports used by auditors to aid their effort involved in SOX and other security compliance work.</li>
                    <li>	Developed custom Python/Unix Shell scripts administered via HP Opsware to apply patches to Linux servers monthly.</li>
                    <li>	Developed a custom web application using Django, Python, and Unix Shell to serve as a front end to a MySQL database that contained server patching details.  This allowed administrators to log in, review, and update patching details for their servers.</li>
                    <li>	Performed use case analysis for requirements gathering.</li>
                    <li>	Developed Ansible playbooks to automate software installation, service monitoring, and update server configuration files of heterogenous server platforms in an environment that contained 4,000+ servers.  This allowed different engineering support teams to be more productive by increasing their bandwidth to address other support issues.</li>
                    <li>	Performed automated code deployments, AWS infrastructure destroy, re-build, and test using Bitbucket, Terraform, and Jenkins.</li>
